# About

I'm Lakshay and I'm from New Delhi, India. Programming is one of my favourite things to do.

I use Python for most stuff, but I'm starting to love Go more and more. 

A lot of my stuff is at [makebyte](https://github.com/makebyte), an opensource organisation I'm the cofounder of.

In my spare time I build fun and useful scripts or contribute to open source projects.
Apart from programming, I click [pictures](https://500px.com/lakshayk), play the ukulele and read books.

I love Pink Floyd, Silicon Valley (TV show) and Reddit.
