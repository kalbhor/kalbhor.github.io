# About

I'm Lakshay and I'm from New Delhi, India. Programming is one of my favourite things to do.

Apart from programming, I click [pictures](https://500px.com/lakshayk), play the ukulele and read books.

I love Pink Floyd, Silicon Valley (TV show) and Breaking Bad.

Currently I'm dabbling in various branches of Software. I use Python for most stuff, but I'm starting to love Go more and more. 

Machine Learning is fun too.

In my spare time I build fun and useful scripts or contribute to open source projects.
