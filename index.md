# About

I'm Lakshay and I'm from New Delhi, India. Programming is one of my favourite things to do.

I use Python for most stuff, but I'm starting to love Go more and more. 

In my spare time I build fun and useful scripts or contribute to open source projects.

Apart from programming, I click [pictures](https://500px.com/lakshayk), play the ukulele and read books.

I love Pink Floyd, Silicon Valley (TV show) and Reddit.
